# GameDev Recipes 
GameDev Recipes is a web application primarily developed for managing and viewing game development tutorials.

The application was developed as I found the youtube playlist system to be lackluster. Having a large amount of videos in one playlist made finding specific tutorials difficult. Unless you created a new tab when selecting a video, the tab would change to the video player, this meant that you would need to reopen your playlist again from the beginning and scroll down to find additional videos.
